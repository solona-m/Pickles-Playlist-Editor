Setup
1)	Download program and place it someplace out of downloads folder
a.	NOTE: Depending on folder permissions, may get errors if you place it in say programs folder, if so move to different location.

2)	Open Folder and Pin “Pickles Playlist Editor.exe” someplace for easy access in future or just Run .exe

3)	(optional) if you don't want to reload the mod after every change, open penumbra. Click the settings tab at top left. Expand Advanced. Check Enable HTTP API.

Getting started
The program will detect and automatically configure itself for DJ Pickles dj mod (the original one!). To use this for thunderdome.exe or another dj mod, or if you aren't seeing any songs, open settings and browse to your dj mod directory. 
DJ Pickles Mod uses sound/bpmloop.scd as the baseline scd. Thunderdome uses sound/dam.scd. [Yue's + Lu's] Dj uses sound/lolo.scd. The program may hang for a little bit after you change these settings, depending on how many songs you have. Be patient.
The default songs that come with thunderdome are recorded in an unsupported encoding, so bpm detection and playback on them are not supported, but will work for new songs you add. If the program is taking a long time to load, you can delete the default thunderdome playlists.

Understanding the Top Buttons

0) Add Songs - lets you add songs from your computer or youtube (you can also drag/drop)
1)	NEW Playlist - Allows you to add new playlists
2)	DELETE:   will allow you to delete any checked marked songs or playlists
WARNING THIS CAN NOT BE UNDONE!!!
3)	Shuffle: as it says, it will shuffle selected songs or playlists around more randomly
4)	Sort by BGM:   will sort the songs as it says
5)	PLAY:   This will allow you to play the selected songs back to hear them.
6)	PAUSE: Pause the selected song
7)	STOP: will stop playing song,
8)	PREVIOUS: will go back 1 song
9)	NEXT: will skip ahead one song
10)	SETTINGS: will allow you to locate the directory of your mod if you aren't using pickles dj mod, set the scd being replaced, disable normalization of songs on import and optionally, reorganize your scds so they're all stored in folders named for each playlist with the file name as the song name (backup your mod before you press this!)

Linking Editor to FFXIV (*skip if using pickles mod and it loads showing all your playlists already)
 
1)	 Click on Options at the Top right corner. 
2)	In the pop up, Click on Browse and then locate your Penumbra addon folder location. 
3)	Once inside the penumbra mods folder, locate the Pickles Playlist (or equivalent playlist) and click “Select folder” then click “OK”.  Pickles Playlist Editor will scan and attempt to add any songs and playlists that already exist to the main screen


Adding Playlists
1)	Click on “NEW” on the top left of the screen. 
This will open a new pop-up window 
2)	On the top line, type the name of the Playlist you wish to create or add songs to.
a.	NOTE: If you add songs in bulk from a folder, make sure that the name is typed exactly as it is already in the Mod otherwise it will make new playlist.

3)	In the 2nd line, click on Browse, and then locate the folder you wish to add songs from.  If you plan on having multiple playlists, it is a good idea to make separate folders for each playlist as will be explained later.
a.	PLEASE NOTE: If you have the same songs in the folder (be that in sub folders or main folder) as you do in your mod already IT WILL MAKE DUPLICATES IN YOUR MOD!
b.	At the time of writing, the Editor does not correctly import .scd files and will give errors.

4)	It is important to note that, the Editor accepts; mp3, .ogg  and possible m4a files. (other types types are easy to add on request)  The if other file types other than .ogg are used, the Editor will then make a new sub folder in the folder you selected for import and will add all the converted .ogg files.
a.	NOTE: This editor automatically creates .scd files for the mod, so no need to do that. However, at the time of writing all those files are named the same but added into individually named song folders in the mod.
5)	One the song folder is selected, click “GO” to import the songs and create the folder.  Depending on the number of songs being added, you might get a green loading bar at the bottom, or all previous playlists and songs might momentarily vanish as import starts, don’t worry, after import finishes, it will refresh to show all. 
 
6)	The Editor keeps track of all the playlists, songs, and the length of time for each set so you know exactly how long each run is.  Simply click on the PLUS icon on the side to expand or collapse the playlist
a.	When importing songs, the “OFF” setting is already added automatically so no need to add one in manually
7)	Deleting songs or playlists are easy. Simply click the box to the side of the playlist or song, then click delete. 
WARNING THIS CAN NOT BE UNDONE!!!

Adding Songs only

8)	Another way to add songs is to select and drag the song MP3 or .ogg files and drop them into the playlist of your choice. Remember to either put the songs 1st into the file folder you store you songs for the mod, or to use .ogg songs so it doesn’t create a new folder /.ogg wherever you imported from. The songs also DO NOT loop!
a.	NOTE: Any changes to the songs or playlists in game with effect the songs in the playlist. (Example: changing the names of the playlist/song in the mod in game or deleting a song will show up in the editor after a refresh.  A forced refresh can be done by clicking “NEW” and then backing out again.
How to Shuffle Song Order
9)	To Shuffle the songs order as they will appear in the mod pack, start by checking the box next to the playlist. 
 
10)	One the desired playlist is selected, simply click the “SHUFFLE” button at the top, and the songs with shuffle around.  
a.	NOTE: at this time, the Playlist will be deselected after every shuffle and will need to be selected again for another shuffle.

Sort by BPM
11)	Sort by BPM (Beats per minute) will shift all the songs between either highest to lowest BPM or from lowest to highest BPM.  This allows for a smoother transition between songs without a sudden shift in tempo, if so desired.
DISCLAIMER
 Any songs added via the manual method and " by Pickles Playlist Editor will “may not” be able to be sorted under certain conditions.  If this happens delete playlist and remake and import all songs via the Editor for best results.
12)	 
Applying Changes to the Mod Pack
13)	 To apply your changes to the mod pack, go to Penumbra and find the Pickles Playlist (or equivalent playlist) and then go to “Edit Mod” then “Reload”. This will apply your changes to your mod once complete.
